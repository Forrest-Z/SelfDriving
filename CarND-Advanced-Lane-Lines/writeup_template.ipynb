    "\n",
    "The goals / steps of this project are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.\n",
    "* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.\n",
    "* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.\n",
    "* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image (\"birds-eye view\").\n",
    "* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.\n",
    "* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.\n",
    "* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.\n",
    "* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.\n",

    "I start by preparing \"object points\", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image.  Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image.  `imgpoints` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I then used the output `objpoints` and `imgpoints` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function.  I applied this distortion correction to the test image \"./camera_cal/calibration1.jpg\" using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained this result: \n",

The result from gradient x and gradient magitude seems similar. Therefore, I used a combination of color, gradient magnitude and gradient direction to generate a binary image.

    "The results show that using color threshold (yellow & white) superiors to using gradient threshold (magnitude & orientation), which weaks the significance of gradient. However, as discussed in the course, lane detection using color is subject to illumination, which may varies in different weather conditions, such as snow, rain or foggy. In these cases, the color based method may fail. Further stategies are needed for improvement. \n"
